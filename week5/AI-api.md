# AI APIs

## ChatGPT, Gemini and others, what are they

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs, like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/)
and [Gemini](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/#architecture), are AI
systems trained on vast amounts of text data. They use patterns in language to generate human-like text, answer
questions, and assist with various tasks like coding, summarization, and more.

### Transformers Architecture

LLMs are built using a [neural network](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/neural-network/) architecture called
transformers, which excels at understanding the context in sequences of text. This allows them to process and generate
coherent, context-aware text based on input prompts.

### ChatGPT (OpenAI)

ChatGPT is part of OpenAI’s series of models (GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4). It’s designed for natural language understanding and
generation, helping with tasks like conversation, creative writing, and programming assistance. It's widely used due to
its accuracy in handling diverse queries.

### Gemini (Google's LLM)

Google's Gemini (part of Vertex AI) is an evolution of its previous language models (PaLM). It offers similar
capabilities to ChatGPT but with enhanced features like multimodal inputs, allowing it to process both text and images
for more complex tasks.

### Differences

ChatGPT and Gemini both use transformer architecture, but ChatGPT focuses on text generation and conversation, while
Gemini integrates advanced multimodal capabilities, including text and image processing. Multimodal capabilities mean
that system can handle multiple types of data (e.g., text and images) as input simultaneously.

Recent versions of ChatGPT are beginning to incorporate some multimodal features. However, Gemini is specifically
designed to handle multimodal inputs effectively.

## AI APIs for Developers

1. **AI APIs**: Interfaces that let developers use AI models without building them from scratch.

2. **Purpose**: They simplify integrating AI functions like text generation or image recognition into applications.

3. **Use Cases**: Commonly used for chatbots, content creation, customer support, and data analysis.

4. **Using AI APIs**: Developers send input data to the API, which processes it using the AI model and returns the
   output. So basically AI APIs behave like any other API, but they use AI models to process the data. The key working
   with any AI tools is the **[prompt](https://www.promptingguide.ai/)**, which is the input data that the model uses to
   generate a response.

5. Some APIs:
    - [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/)
    - [Google Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai?hl=en)

## Terminology

- **Prompt**: The input text or instruction sent to the model to generate a response.
- **Completion**: The text generated by the model in response to the prompt.
- **Fine-tuning**: Customizing the model with specific training data to tailor its responses to particular needs or
  domains.
- **Temperature**: A parameter that controls the randomness of the model’s responses; lower values make output more
  focused, higher values increase variability.
- **Token**: A unit of text, such as a word or punctuation mark, that the AI model processes and generates in response
  to input.
- **Context Window**: The amount of preceding text the model can consider when generating a response; affects coherence
  and relevance.

## Assigment 1: Comment Generator

Generate an automatic response to a YouTube comment. Try different prompts to see how the model responses. Tell the AI to be nice, funny, mean, sarcastic, etc. Ask the AI to generate a comment for in a particular style. Describe the person who is responding to the comment. Use the OpenAI API to generate the response.

- Clone [this repo](https://github.com/ilkkamtk/AI-commenter-starter) to get started.
- Instead of using openai library, use fetchData to make a post request to the server.
- See https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create for more information
- You don't need an API key if you use the URL stored in .env and Metropolia VPN
  - Example: instad of `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` use `process.env.OPENAI_API_URL + '
    /v1/chat/completions'`
  - Value for OPENAI_API_URL is in Oma/assignments
- Use Postman for testing

## Assignment 2: Image generator

Generate a YouTube thumbnail image using the OpenAI API. The thumbnail should be related to a video about a specific topic. For example, if the video is about space, the thumbnail could include stars, planets, or astronauts and possibly have splash text like "Explore the Universe!" You could also try to generate an image edit or variation of an existing image.

You can use the same starter code as in the previous assignment. Use the OpenAI API to generate the image. [Here is an example](https://github.com/ilkkamtk/AI-BE/blob/main/src/middlewares.ts#L49) of using image generation and saving the result to a file.
- [Create image](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create)
- [Create image edit](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/createEdit)
- [Create image variation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/createVariation)

Use Postman for testing
